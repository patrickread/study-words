# Studying Sight Words

A simple Python-based game for a young child to study "sight words".

## Quickstart

### Assumptions

1. This was built using Python 3.10.x. YMMV on other versions
2. This game requires the `say` CLI on MacOS.

### Startup

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Use virtualenv if that's your thing.
2. (optional) Edit `words.txt` to add/delete sight words as appropriate
3. (optional) Edit `affirmations.txt` for fun
4. (optional) set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to get sentence samples while studying words
5. Run `python main.py`
